# Data_Science_Statistics_Drawer
This will be a repository to hold useful code or notes from my adventures in STAT 489: Principles of Data Science and Statistics
Layout:
- Homework One: An introductory Python assignment turned into a treatise on simple functional analytics
- Linear Analysis: A survey of Linear Algebra
- Statistics Analysis: A survey of Statistics
- Probability Analysis: A survey of Probability Theory
- Hypothesis Analysis: A survey of Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals, P-hacking, A/B Tests, Bayesian Inference
- Gradient Analysis: A survey of Gradient Descent, the popular mechanic involved in Machine Learning
- Data Aquistion: A survey of introductory Regular Expressions, Web Scraping, and Beautiful Soup to mine text

Please note:
 
While the code is mostly verbatim from the Data Science From Scratch book by Joel Grus, I am writing this
code and the comments as I work through the book as a reference. Currently, the goal is to complete my 
studies on the book, implementing every concept, and then follow up with analysis exercises on every
topic in IPython Notebooks in order to tell a better story with analysis.

Purpose:

My purpose for utilizing this "drawer" is to have a repository dedicated to learning and exercising
understanding and eventually mastery over the fundamental concepts which are necessary to carry out
exploratory data analysis, data mining, machine learning, and more.
