Note: These code snippets are derived from Data Science from Scratch First Principles by Joel Grus.
      For right now, I'll be transferring the code from the book, explaining the functions, and creating
      an API that can be utilized in further analysis. While some of these functions may be part of 
      the Python standard library or a package already created, I thought it would be useful to begin
      creating my own data science toolbelt for the future, with self written commentary.
